# Landscape Image Generation Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

In this project, we generate landscape image by implimenting GANs on Landscape dataset. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a unique approach to generative modeling, characterized by a competitive interplay between two neural networks: Generators and Discriminators. 


The GAN architecture includes a generator, employing transpose convolutional layers, and a discriminator, using convolutional layers, both trained in a competitive framework. The training process involves an alternating strategy where the discriminator learns to differentiate between real and fake images, while the generator improves its ability to create convincing images to fool the discriminator. 

The power of generative modeling is such that it can generate the following faces, which are not actually real person. The results are pretty fascinating:

## Dataset Preparation
The dataset is prepared by downloading and preprocessing Pok√©mon images, which includes:

1. Resizing images
2. Center cropping
3. Converting images to tensors
4. Normalizing the data


## Model Architecture
* Generator: Defined using transpose convolutional layers to generate realistic images from random noise.
* Discriminator: Defined using convolutional layers to distinguish between real and fake images.


## Training Process
The training process involves alternating between:

1. Training the Discriminator: To distinguish between real and generated (fake) images.
2. Training the Generator: To produce more realistic images that can fool the discriminator.


## Visualization
The training progress is visualized through:

1. Loss and Score Plots: Showing the performance of both the generator and discriminator over time.
2. Generated Image Samples: Displaying the quality of images produced by the generator at different stages of training.
